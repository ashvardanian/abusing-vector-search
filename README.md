# Absuing Vector Search

This repo contains the code for the ["Abusing Vector Search for Texts, Maps, and Chess ♟️" article](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/abusing-vector-search/).

- `gis.py` - working with Geo-Spatial data using HNSW and Haversine distance.
- `stocks.py` - covariance analysis for stocks using HNSW.
- `tokens.py` - taking the tokenizer from BERT, but forgetting the model :)
